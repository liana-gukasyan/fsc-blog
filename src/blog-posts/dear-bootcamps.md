The abundance of coding bootcamps with low admissions standards is a ticking time bomb, and itâ€™s already claiming casualties.

Effects of low admissions standards are most immediately felt by underprepared students who later become bootcamp dropouts or unemployable alumni. Beyond that, the feedback loop created by low entry standards is leading to wider harm across the industry.

```javascript
import moment from 'moment'

export function formatDate(date) {
  let publishDate = moment(date)
  publishDate = moment().format('MMMM D, YYYY')
  return publishDate
}

```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
