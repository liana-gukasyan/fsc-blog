[Top Takeaways from SwitchUp’s 2016  Coding Bootcamp Survey](http://www.switchup.org/research/are-coding-bootcamps-worth-it-review)

In the past 5 years, Coding Bootcamps & Immersive Courses have gone from an unconventional education option to a thriving industry.  With the allure of high paying tech jobs and the recent announcement that [Federal Student Loans now cover some Coding Boot Camps](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/14/448570520/federal-student-loans-for-coding-boot-camps), it’s no wonder enrollment is soaring.

But are Programming Bootcamps worth the investment of time and money, and will you really graduate with the skills needed to land that Web Dev job? Many bootcamps claim you can, but with little industry regulation, and in light of [recent scandals](http://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/devschool-coding-bootcamps.html), it can be hard to know if your investment will pay off.  

[SwitchUp](https://www.switchup.org/), a resource for prospective bootcamp students and alumni, was started to answer that question and shed more transparency on this new industry.

Over the past year, we have surveyed alumni and gathered information about coding bootcamp students and their experiences. After hearing from more than 1,000 students and alum, we’ve [crunched the numbers](https://www.switchup.org/research/are-coding-bootcamps-worth-it-review) and published the results.
 

1. **63% of graduates reported an increase in salary. Those who reported an increase saw their salary jump by an average of $22,700.**  
Bootcamp grads continue to report a salary increase overall, and this number is up from 59% last year. Grads are also seeing a bigger salary bump. Respondents in 2015 saw a salary increase reported an average increase of $18,101 within six months. This year, respondents saw an average increase of $22,700 after six months.
 
2. **Women are more prevalent in coding bootcamps than in Computer Science programs.**
Coding Bootcamps have been praised for adding diversity to tech, and this is definitely true when it comes to female programmers. In 2016, our data found that 43% of coding bootcamp grads were women, up from 41% in 2015. Conversely, just 12% of computer science grads are women.
Bootcamps have successfully proved that people from every background can make a career change into tech. It remains to be seen if computer science programs will made the same diversity gains in the future.

3. **Bootcamp Market Growth & Evolution**  
Have you noticed coding bootcamps popping up everywhere? The coding bootcamp market is booming; and we don’t see it slowing down anytime soon. Our survey looks at how the coding bootcamp market has grown (and continues to grow!) since 2013.
